## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **pygame**: For MIDI audio playback
- **pillow**: For image processing and display
- **tkinter**: For GUI (included with Python)

### Files
- `hello_world_rickroll.py` - Main application file
- `never_gonna_give_you_up.mid` - MIDI file of the song
- `rick_astley_8bit_dancing.gif` - 8-bit animated dancing Rick Astley (auto-generated)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (secure versions)
- `LICENSE_NOTICE.md` - License compliance documentation

### Features Implemented
- âœ… Clickable "World" text with hover effects
- âœ… MIDI audio playback with looping and 3-second skip (bypasses silence)
- âœ… 8-bit animated dancing Rick Astley GIF
- âœ… 4-frame dancing animation synchronized with music
- âœ… Toggle on/off functionality
- âœ… Error handling for missing files
- âœ… Retro terminal-style UI design

## Customization

You can customize the app by:
- Replacing `rick_astley_8bit_dancing.gif` with your own animated 8-bit GIF
- Changing colors in the GUI code
- Modifying the dance animation frames
- Adjusting the 3-second skip timing for different MIDI files
- Adding more visual effects
- Using different audio formats (though MIDI gives that retro feel!)

## Known Issues

- MIDI playback may not work on all systems due to pygame limitations
- MIDI position seeking may not work on some systems (gracefully falls back to playing from beginning)
- The auto-generated dancing Rick Astley GIF is simple 8-bit art (you can replace it with a better one)

## Credits

- MIDI file sourced from BitMidi
- Built with Python, tkinter, pygame, and PIL
- Created as a fun coding exercise combining GUI programming with multimedia
